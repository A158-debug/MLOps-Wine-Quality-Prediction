Modelling a Kaggle dataset of [red wine properties and quality ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). 

- In this project, I've set up GitHub Actions and Continuous Machine Learning (CML) to trigger specific actions whenever there's a push to this repository.

## Workflow

Here's a high-level overview of the workflow in this repository:

1. When a push is made to this repository, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
2. The workflow includes steps to install dependencies, train the model, and generate model performance metrics.
3. CML is used to create reports and comments, providing insights into model quality.
4. Reports, comments, and other information are shared right here on this repository.
